I am writing to express my interest in the doctoratal program in Social Sciences, Economics & Business at the Institute of Business Analytics and Technology Transformation. 

Thanks to my graduation of the higher technical education institute in electrical engineering and my graduation of the bachelor program in Economics I gained a valuable combination of technical and econmic knowledge.
This knowledge prepared me exceptionally for the masters degree in Economic and Business Analytics, which increased my interest in the field of Business Analytics especially the practical application of mathematical optimization.
During the work on my master thesis on the topic of the nested p-center problem I have not only learned a lot about combinatorial optimization, but furthermore I was able to improve my programming skills by learning a new programming language.
In addition, I have also improved other skills like time management and planning of larger projects, scientific writing and presenting scientific research.

I believe that this doctoratal program is the best place to continue my academic career and to further improve my knowledge, as it allows me to use the tools I have been given in my past eductational steps to be a valuable part of the academic society.
